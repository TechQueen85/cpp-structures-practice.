# 🔹 C++ Structures Practice

This repository contains a single C++ file (`structs.cpp`) that covers **structures in C++** with detailed comments and examples for learning purposes.

---

## 📂 File

- **structs.cpp**  
  Includes code and explanations for:

  - ✅ **Basic usage of structures**  
    How to declare and use structures (`struct Student`, `struct student1`, `struct address`).

  - ✅ **Accessing structure members using pointers**  
    Demonstrates using pointers to work with structure objects (`student1 c, *p; p = &c; ...`).

  - ✅ **Structures inside loops (array of structs)**  
    Shows how to store and process multiple students using an array of structs with input/output.

  - ✅ **Nested structures (struct inside another struct)**  
    Example of having one struct (`address`) inside another (`student`) and accessing nested data.

  - ✅ **Passing structures to functions (by value, by reference, by pointer)**  
    Explains different ways to pass structures to functions and how each method affects data.

  - ✅ **Using structures with 2D arrays and functions**  
    Demonstrates working with a 2D array of structures and passing it to a function (`printStudents`).

## 🎯 Purpose

This file is written as a **learning resource**.  
Each concept is explained through commented examples, making it easier for beginners to understand how **structures work in C++**.

---

## ⚡ How to Run

1. Download `structs.cpp`.  
2. Compile it using any C++ compiler (e.g., g++):  

   ```bash
   g++ structs.cpp -o structs
   ./structs
Since the file has multiple independent code blocks,

Uncomment the section you want to test

Recompile and run again

📝 Notes
This file is meant purely for practice and learning, not production code.

It covers both fundamental and advanced uses of structures in C++.

Code is commented for easy understanding.

🧑‍💻 Useful for students and beginners who want to strengthen their understanding of C++ structures.
